The sun hangs low over the Mojave Desert, painting sand dunes in shades of amber and gold.

Two massive freight trains approach on parallel tracks, their headlights piercing the heat shimmer.

Ancient red rock formations stand as silent witnesses to this industrial ballet.

The trains thunder past each other, dust swirling in their wake like desert spirits.

They fade into opposite horizons as twilight transforms the landscape into purple silhouettes.
